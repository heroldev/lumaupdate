# Luma Updater

Formerly known as "ARN Updater"

A `boot.firm` updater for Luma3DS and boot9strap (formerly AuReiNand) as a 3DS homebrew (no more SD swaps!)

## Usage

Originally from [Hamcha's wiki](https://github.com/Hamcha/lumaupdate/wiki):

For boot9strap Users:
1. Install Luma Updater's CIA then launch it.
2. Select latest stable version.

For HBL/Rosalina Users:
1. Enable Patch ARM9 access in your Luma3DS configuration (may not be needed depending on your Luma version).
2. Launch the HBL then Luma Updater.
3. Select latest stable version.

## To possibly work on
* N/A

## Compiling Requirements

- Your usual 3DS compilation environment
- Latest* ctrulib (the one currently bundled with devKitPro won't cut it)
- [makerom](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Makerom) and [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool) somewhere in your `PATH` environment

#### Optional

- `zip` binary for generating release archives (`make pkg`)

## Compiling

`make` should create the output folder and fill it with both the 3dsx and the cia builds

`make 3dsx` will only build the 3dsx version [outdated]

#### Extra flags

`make CITRA=1` disables features that aren't properly emulated on Citra (HTTPc) for easier testing

`make DEBUG=1` will disable compile-time optimizations entirely
